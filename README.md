# About Hevy Insights <!-- omit from toc -->

Hevy Insights is a dynamic web application that provides insights and analytics of your workouts and exercises. It visualizes workout data from the Hevy app in a clean dashboard so that you can always keep track of your progress!

In the Hevy app you can only see your stats and progress up to 3 months for free, otherwise you need the paid Hevy PRO membership.
Hevy Insights allows you to log in with your Hevy credentials and fetch your workout data directly from Hevy's API, providing you with detailed visualizations and historical data up to the date of your account creation - no PRO membership required!

# Features

- **Authentication**: Multiple login options for flexibility:
  - **Hevy Credentials (OAuth2)**: Login with your Hevy username/email and password using OAuth2 with automatic reCAPTCHA v3 handling (no PRO membership required)
  - **Hevy PRO API Key**: Use your revokable Hevy PRO API key from [hevy.com/settings?developer](https://hevy.com/settings?developer)
  - **CSV Upload**: Upload your exported workout CSV file from the Hevy app
  - Authentication tokens are stored in **secure HttpOnly cookies** (not accessible to JavaScript, protecting against XSS attacks)
  - User preferences are stored in your browser's local storage
- **Dashboard**: Interactive charts and statistics of your workouts, including volume, muscle distribution and hours trained.
- **Workout History**: Workout logs with detailed exercise information up to the date of account creation - card or list design.
- **Exercises**: View all exercises with video thumbnails and detailed stats.
  - **Plateau Detection**: Automatically detects when your performance has plateaued on an exercise
  - **Strength Tracking**: Shows if you're gaining or losing strength over your recent sessions
- **Body Measurements**: Track your weight and body fat percentage over time with interactive charts.
- **Custom Settings**: Individualize your experience when using Hevy Insights.
- **Languages**: Language support for 🇺🇸, 🇩🇪 and 🇪🇸.

## Plateau & Strength Detection

Hevy Insights includes an intelligent analysis system that tracks your performance across the last 5 sessions (configurable) for each exercise and provides real-time feedback:

### Detection Types <!-- omit from toc -->

- **🟡 Plateau**: Your performance has stayed relatively consistent
  - Triggered when weight stays within **~0.5kg** and reps within **~1 rep** across at least 5 sessions
  
- **🟢 Gaining Strength**: You're making progress!
  - Triggered when weight increases by **>2kg** OR reps increase by **>2** (with stable/increasing weight) across at least 5 sessions
  
- **🔴 Declining Strength**: Performance is decreasing
  - Triggered when weight decreases by **>2kg** OR reps decrease by **>2** (with stable/ decreasing weight) across at least 5 sessions
  
- **⚪ Insufficient Data**: Not enough workout history yet
  - Displayed when an exercise has been performed fewer than **5 times**

### How It Works <!-- omit from toc -->

The analysis algorithm:

1. Collects data from your last N workout sessions for each exercise
2. Tracks the **maximum weight** and **reps at max weight** for each session
3. Compares the first half of sessions against the second half to identify trends
4. Displays a colored badge on each exercise card with the current status

This feature helps you identify when it's time to:

- **Increase weight** (when plateaued)
- **Celebrate progress** (when gaining)
- **Take recovery time** or **check form** (when declining)
- **Build more history** (when insufficient data)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Why the differences in the login modes?** It's because not every login method provides the same data to use. The [Hevy PRO API](https://api.hevyapp.com/docs/#/) key login only provides data for a small amount of features compared to what you can see inside the Hevy app (which is using the **Hevy Credentials** login method). The CSV upload is the most basic one, it only provides the data that is contained in the CSV file you can export from the Hevy app, which is by far not everything that the Hevy API provides.

# Future Goals

- Better logging
- Add visual representation of trained muscle groups (body heatmap)
- Add calendar filter
- In-depth muscle analysis page
- Remove emojis, use icons instead
- Resort/group CSS styles better
- Dashboard: Top stats: Display them more in rows instead of big "buttons". Maybe like "🏋️ 25 Total Workouts * 💪 282.741,5 kg Total Volume * ⏱️ 34h 15m Total Time Trained"
- CSV upload: PRs not shown and muscle regions missing
- To get more space on mobile: Dashboard charts: Hide Filters. Add something similar to the „i“ button which shows the filters
- Better tablet screen responsiveness
- Dashboard recent PRs: Add unit (seconds/formatted minutes) for "Best Duration" stat
- Workouts pages: PR "best duration" not localized and no unit shown
- Plateu detection not working correctly in Hevy PRO API key login mode
- Add ability on profile page to change account privacy settings (public/private) and opt-in/out of settings like "comments_push_enabled"
- "Clear all" button to flush localStorage?
- Switch `requests` library to `httpx` to be consistent?
- Let the user choose the primary and secondary colors in settings
- Switch to per page localization instead of using `global.{n}.{y}` and reusing the same string from other pages
- Support for distance-based workouts (running, cycling, etc.) and their specific stats (e.g., pace, distance)
  - Seperate distance stats for duraion-based workouts (e.g. Dead Hang)
- "Top 3 Best Sets" not actually showing the best sets for bodyweight exercises

## High-Level-Flow

- **index.html**: Browser loads this HTML document first. It defines the root node `<div id="app"></div>` and includes `<script type="module" src="/src/main.ts">`.
- **main.ts**: Entry script runs. Vite serves ES modules and applies HMR in dev. We `createApp(App)`, install `Pinia` and the `Router`, then `mount("#app")`.
- **App.vue**: Root component renders the global shell (fixed sidebar + main). On mount and after each route change it checks `localStorage` for `hevy_access_token` to toggle sidebar visibility and protect routes.
- **Router**: Resolves the current URL (`/login`, `/dashboard`, `/workouts-card`, `/workouts-list`) and renders the matched view inside `<router-view />`. Auth guards check authentication status from backend via `/api/auth/status` endpoint.
- **View Components**: The matched page component (`Login.vue`, `Dashboard.vue`, `Workouts_Card.vue`, `.....vue`) runs `setup()` and lifecycle hooks (`onMounted`).
- **Pinia Store** (*frontend/src/stores/hevy_cache.ts*): Centralized state with 5‑minute caching for workouts (`workoutsLastFetched`). Exposes actions `fetchUserAccount()`, `fetchWorkouts(force)` and getters like `username`, `hasWorkouts`. Prevents redundant API calls when navigating.
- **Axios Service** (*frontend/src/services/api.ts*): Configures base URL with `withCredentials: true` for cookie support. Authentication is handled automatically via HttpOnly cookies set by the backend. All frontend API calls to the backend go through these typed helpers.
- **Backend** (FastAPI): Serves `/api` endpoints. Supports dual authentication (OAuth2 Bearer tokens or PRO API keys) via HttpOnly cookies. Proxies requests to the official Hevy API. Frontend receives JSON responses and Vue reactivity updates the UI.

### API Authentication Flow

**OAuth2 Authentication (Credentials):**

1. User logs in via `/api/login` endpoint with Hevy credentials
2. Backend automatically generates reCAPTCHA v3 token using Playwright (headless Chrome)
3. Backend authenticates with Hevy API using OAuth2 and receives `access_token` + `refresh_token`
4. Backend sets **HttpOnly cookies** (`hevy_access_token`, `hevy_refresh_token`, `hevy_token_expires_at`)
5. Browser automatically sends cookies with subsequent API requests
6. Backend reads authentication from cookies and proxies requests to Hevy API
7. On token expiration, backend automatically refreshes tokens via `/api/refresh_token` using refresh token cookie

**PRO API Key Authentication:**

1. User validates API key via `/api/validate_api_key` endpoint
2. Backend sets **HttpOnly cookies** (`hevy_api_key`, marker token)
3. Browser automatically sends cookies with subsequent API requests
4. Backend routes requests to Hevy PRO API endpoints

## API in Dev vs Prod

- In development, the frontend talks directly to the FastAPI server: the Axios base URL in [frontend/src/services/api.ts](frontend/src/services/api.ts) is `http://localhost:5000/api` when `import.meta.env.PROD` is false.
- In production, the Axios base URL is `/api` (same origin). Requests resolve as `https://your-domain/api/...` and are reverse‑proxied to the backend by Nginx.
- The `import.meta.env.PROD` flag is set automatically by Vite at build time. No extra configuration is required.

### When nginx.conf is used

- The file [frontend/nginx.conf](frontend/nginx.conf) is used when the built frontend is served by Nginx (e.g. on a server with Nginx).
- It performs two critical roles:
   - SPA fallback: routes like `/dashboard` and `/workouts-list` return `index.html` so client‑side routing works.
   - API proxy: requests to `/api/...` are forwarded to the FastAPI backend (e.g., `http://backend:5000`). This keeps a single public origin and avoids CORS in production.
- If your deployment does not use Nginx (e.g., serving static files from a CDN without proxying), ensure your hosting platform supports SPA fallback and adjust the API base accordingly.

### Direct-to-Backend with CORS

- In local development, the frontend dev server runs on `http://localhost:5173` and the backend on `http://localhost:5000`. Because these are different origins, FastAPI enables CORS middleware so the browser can call the backend directly.
- CORS setup in `fastapi_server.py`.
- In production behind Nginx, CORS is not required because the frontend and `/api` share the same origin.
