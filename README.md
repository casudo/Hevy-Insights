# Overview

Hevy Insights is a dynamic web application that provides insights and analytics for users of the Hevy fitness app. It visualizes workout data from the Hevy app in a clean dashboard so that you can always keep track of your progress!

In the Hevy app you can often only see your stats and progress for a limited time (mostly 3 months) or with a paid PRO membership. Hevy Insights allows you to log in with your Hevy credentials and fetch your workout data directly from Hevy's API, providing you with detailed visualizations and historical data up to the date of your account creation.
